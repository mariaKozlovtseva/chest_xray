In training we use no data augmentation, because it doesn't give any sense to X-ray images. There are already preprocessed files except Train data and 2 files for weights for the best models (best_model_1.h5 - when you use val dataset as validation data in training; best_model_2.h5 - when you use test dataset as validation data in training).
